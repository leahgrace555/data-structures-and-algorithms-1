## Array Shift
- Problem Domain: Insert a number into the middle of an array.

- Approach/Efficiency: I created a new array that was based off the initial array.length +1. Then gave new values to the array.

## Array Reverse
- Problem Domain: Reverse the order of an array.

- Approach/Efficiency: I modified the original array, replacing the first and last index. Then replacing the 2nd and 4th. 

- Instructed that one was not needed for this day (fist day of class)

## Array Binary Search
- Problem Domain: Sort an array, then find a key value from that array and display it's index

- Approach/Efficiency: I decided to create a function that would find the middle of the array, then check whether the key was higher or lower. Then, it would set a new middle and check for the key again. Repeat until the key is found, if none existed then display -1.
